$ find .git/objects -type f         	  \\to show different types of objects in .git/objects(object database)

$  git cat-file -t <object>         	  \\shows us the type of the object represented by a particular hash

$ git cat-file -p <object>                \\shows the contents of the file associated with the hash value of the object

	we can also use -
$ git cat-file --batch             	  \\to print object information and contents for each object provided by standard_input(stdin)

here,<object> is 40-hex hash value of object/node in git-graph
